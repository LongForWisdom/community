# MakerDAO Communications Team Mandate Draft

## Introduction

#### Motivation and Context

There is a need to create an improved system of communication between the DAO, the Maker ecosystem, the greater DeFi community, and the crypto ecosystem writ large. We’re organizing as an independent team who can communicate objective (governance votes/polls, state of monetary policy), subjective (quotes from community members), and historical information about MakerDAO. The messaging team serves broadly as a relayer.

#### The need for a communications team

Currently, anything that the community doesn't take responsibility for falls on the foundation. Interim Governance facilitators only have so much time in a day to keep moderation going and the MIPs cycle on track. New users constantly get lost in a deluge of information tat is fractured and scales in technical opacity. Adding a contributing team that condenses activity and surfaces signal for everyone’s benefit is a welcome one.
One can frame this team as a community driven plan attempting to answer a few questions:

- How does scientific governance communicate? Or how can we be scientific in communicating?
- How to be thorough/comprehensive understandings of events/procedures/news?
- How to condense public sentiment? How to condense forum sentiment?
- How do we make statements on behalf of the DAO, (if we even should in certain cases)?
- How can a group within a DAO improve the initiatives and working groups within it?

With the introduction of MIPs, we think this is a good initiative to bootstrap on the forums and for the ecosystem. If this proves successful and a value-add, we can apply as a MIPs domain team in the near future.

*_Note: Currently much of the membership is on hourly agreements with the Foundation’s Community-Development department. We hope to use our operations as a model for compensation via the surplus buffer in the protocol someday._

## Principles

Our slogan is “Aggregate and Simplify.” We try to embody journalistic integrity, presenting information ‘as-is’ with any bias clearly indicated or polled from the community. Some of our principles include: objectivity, simplicity, integrity, brevity.
