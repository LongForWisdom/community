# Voting Methods used in Governance Polls

Note that these descriptions apply specifically to the implementations of these options within Maker Governance.

## Binary Vote

### What is a Binary vote?

A binary vote is a vote in which there are only two options and voters may vote for one of these options. Usually, in a binary vote, a single option is proposed and set against the status quo, however, this isn't a hard requirement, and in rare circumstances, there may be polls that offer two competing proposals in situations where the status quo is deemed to not be acceptable. Most frequently the options are 'Yes' (Accept this proposal) and 'No' (Do not accept this proposal and remain with the status quo).

Binary votes will also include an 'Abstain' option. Votes for this option will be discarded when calculating the winner.

### What are the outcomes in a Binary vote?

In a binary vote, the option that has the highest number of votes at the time the poll closes will win the poll. Note that 'Abstain' cannot win in a binary vote.

In the event of a tie between the two options, whichever option best represents the status quo will be deemed the victor.

### How do I express my preferences in a Binary vote?

In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. 

Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference, you should abstain.

## Plurality Vote (AKA First Past the Post)

### What is a Plurality vote?

A plurality vote is a vote in which there are multiple options and voters may vote for one of these options. Usually, a Plurality vote will include an option for the status quo, but this is not a hard requirement and in rare circumstances, it may be excluded where the status quo is deemed to not be acceptable.

Plurality votes will also include an 'Abstain' option. Votes for this option will be discarded when calculating the winner.

### What are the outcomes in a Plurality vote?

In a Plurality vote, the option that has the highest number of votes at the time the poll closes will win the poll, regardless of whether or not that option holds a majority of the total votes.

In the event of a tie between the two options, whichever option best is closest to the status quo will be deemed the victor.

### How do I express my preferences in a Plurality vote?

In a plurality vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option that you prefer.

Alternatively, if you would accept any of the listed options and have no preference, you should abstain.

## Instant-Runoff Vote (AKA Ranked Choice Voting)

### What is an Instant-Runoff vote?

An Instant-Runoff vote is a vote in which there are multiple options and voters may rank any number of those options in an order of their choosing. Usually, an Instant-Runoff vote will include an option for the status quo, but this is not a hard requirement and in rare circumstances, it may be excluded where the status quo is deemed to not be acceptable.

The winner in Instant-Runoff voting is calculated in multiple rounds. Each round if no option has a majority of the remaining votes, the lowest scoring option is eliminated and any votes for that option are transferred to the next ranked option if one exists or are eliminated if not. Rounds end once one option has a majority of the remaining votes.

Instant-Runoff votes will also include an 'Abstain' option. Votes for this option will be discarded when calculating the winner.

### What are the outcomes in an Instant-Runoff vote?

In an Instant-Runoff vote, the option with the greatest number of votes (after the run-off rounds and excluding abstain) at the time the poll closes will win the poll and proceed to an executive vote.

Note that an additional requirement may be applied to the poll to require that the outcome have a 50% majority of the *total* votes cast in the poll in order to proceed to an executive. If this is the case for a given poll, it will be listed clearly in the 'Outcomes' section.

### How do I express my preferences in an Instant-Runoff vote?

In an Instant-Runoff vote, you may rank any number of options in the order of preference. As a general rule, you should rank every option you would be willing to vote for if it was included in an executive vote. By not ranking an option you signal that you are not willing to vote for it in an executive vote.

Alternatively, if you would accept any of the listed options and have no preference as to which, you should vote with 'Abstain' as your first choice and rank no other choices.
