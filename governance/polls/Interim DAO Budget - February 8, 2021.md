# Interim DAO Budget - February 8, 2021

The Governance Facilitator(s) have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the DAO Autonomous Group. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The DAO Autonomous Group has been growing a lot since its inception. We now have 10+ members actively working to move towards the decentralized future of Maker. As our responsibilities have been scaling up, so have our bills. So far the Foundation has been able to cover most things through the grants program, but with the introduction of the community-led PSM we are now racking up costs which need to be covered. We believe it is time to take the next step towards the DAO funding operation of the protocol.

The DAO Autonomous Group proposes setting up a 4-of-5 Gnosis multi-sig wallet owned by all mandated domain facilitators who opt-in. This will initially consist of the following mandated actors:

 * @LongForWisdom - 0x66f40F044E0e2F77bB746e3275E82e88dCBA2D69
 * @Primoz - 0x5d67d5B1fC7EF4bfF31967bE2D2d7b9323c1521c
 * @SebVentures - 0x0D61C8b6CA9669A36F351De3AE335e9689dd9C5b
 * @juanjuan - 0xFCa6e196c2ad557E64D9397e283C2AFe57344b75
 * @hexonaut - 0x18CaE82909C31b60Fe0A9656D76406345C9cb9FB

The multi-sig wallet can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73f09254a81e1F835Ee442d1b3262c1f1d7A13ff#code).

Governance will have full administrative access to the multi-sig, so as to provide a safety mechanism for lost keys.

As of this poll 52,627.15 will be used to cover previous expenses:

Quantstamp Audit: 40,000.00
PSM / DssGovRewards Development Time: 11,435.70
Deployment Gas Cost: 1,191.45

These expenses and any additional will be cateloged in a publically accessible document. The remaining amount will be used to cover ongoing community development on things such as DssGovRewards and anything else the Foundation grants program cannot cover.

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-interim-dao-operating-budget/5924) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* A one-time payment of 100,000 Dai to the DAO multi-sig will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
